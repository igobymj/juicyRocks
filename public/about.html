                <strong>Juice Rocks</strong> is a demonstrator of the joyful effects of "juicy feedback" which can
                enhance the feel and experience of a game dramatically, without any change to the underlying gameplay.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                The project was conceived by <strong>Michael John (MJ)</strong>
                during his time at <strong>UC Santa Cruz</strong> and was built with the assistance of professor Eddie
                Melcer, and graduate students Sam Shields,
                Weiqiang Chen, and Jonathan Leland. The project is under constant improvement, and feedback is welcome
                at michael.mj.john@gmail.com!

                The term "Juice" or "Juicy feedback" is most often credited to <strong><a

                "A juicy game feels alive and responds to everything you do – tons of cascading action and response for
                minimal user input. It makes the player feel powerful and in control of the world"

                This project takes particular inspiration from the presentation <em>Juice it or Lose it</em> by
                <strong>Martin Jonasson</strong> and <strong>Petri Purho</strong>, preserved in <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pJGJGJGJGJ">this amazing video</a>, but
                their Breakout project has been largely lost along with Adobe Flash.*
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                The intent of the project is as an educational tool for anyone who wants to learn or teach about
                juice... but it's also kind of a fun toy.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                Of course the primary debt of gratitude goes to <strong>Ed Logg, Lyle Rains, Wendi Allen</strong> and
                the geniuses at Atari who originated the coin-op classic <strong>Asteroids</strong>, one of the most
                perfect games ever created.
